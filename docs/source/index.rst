Cyclops customization
===================================
Cyclops stack is a purpose built scalable platform designed to handle tracking, measuring 
millions of modern datacenter resources such as compute nodes, networking elements, storage
units, and virtualized containers and run-time elements, in near-real-time and at scale.
The platform is fully customizable and can track any custom resources. In this guide, you
will learn how to work with any custom resource, how to send metrics into the platform, how
to set up SKUs, set pricing, configure plans, in order to monetize any custom resource.
